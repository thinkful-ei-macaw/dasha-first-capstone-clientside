This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). FOR USER STORIES AND APP FLOW, SEE BELOW

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### What is this all about??

Users (who are they):

- Fashion lovers who are sick of never being able to find what to wear.
- Love organising outfits and creating wardrobe clusters.
- Want to create a lookbook for the week, or month, or plan vacation wardrobe in advance.
- Don't want to spend a ton of time standing in front of a close looking for something.

What this app does:

- You can add your favourite pieces to a virtual closet
- Play around with separates to create a whole outfit
- Organise outfits by occasion
- Able to compile a collection, or lookbook, to access later for easily choosing a pre-planned outfit

New Users:

- Can sign up for an account
- create collections or lookbooks
- immediately start adding outfits

existing users:

- Can sign in
- view existing collections
- Add outfits from a third party api
- Add outfits from their own photos
- Add events or days (vacation wardrobe,
- work wardrobe by day, etc

users can view:

- Start screen
- Closet view

how is this app different from Shopstyle.it -- shopstyle searches through third party apis to find outfits based on
keywords (i.e. black jacket). It allows the user to see the price and links to buy this item. Users can also save the item
in their collection. The app is primarily used for affiliate marketing by bloggers and influencers. Unfortunately, once
the item is sold out or no longer available, it disappears from the app. This means that users can't add some of their
favourite items to lookbooks, if the items are not currently for sale. The virtual closet app fixes this issue. Users can
add their own clothes, and not search through endless search results for something that looks 'similar.' As a wearer of
mostly vintage clothing, I myself have run into problems with shopstyle and cannot use the app as the clothing I own is no
longer sold anywhere. Additionally, the virtual closet is for personal use, and does not require the user to add payment
information, tax ids or paypal link.
